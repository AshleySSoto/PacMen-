# PacMen-
This is a coding assignment that we have been building on for several weeks. It started as a simple pacman, to moving the pacman, to creating several pacman spawning at several speeds. 
Overall, I learned quite a bit. As we built upon the pervious code, this last portion proved to be a bit of a challange. With time I was able to get it to spawn correctly within the parameters that were set. 
The moving pacman is a great frist time project for someone trying to learn how to intergrate moving objects within their web design. 
With time and expierence these pacman can become : bigger or smaller, faster or slower, spawn at different rates, just depends on the level of coding put into it.
